This folder contains sample runs and outputs for the program.<br>
We use CMETNet_CNN_train.py and CMETNet_COMB_train.py to train/predict the CMETNet CNN model and CMETNet COMB models on the data samples without any options.<br>
The results_ensemble.py helps us to ensemble the results produced by the models for displaying in the terminal and save in the results folder. Even this python script doesn't need any options to run like the above scripts.
